Just give me your care now
Don't me leave to saving grace
She comes out at midnight
To take all my cares away

Give me some perspective
Show me every shade of love
Can you ever find me?
Take me to higher ground

Higher and Higher and Higher
And Higher and Higher
Those weren't over

Higher and Higher and Higher
And Higher and Higher
Hope we never calm down

My body is wounded
But I'm off to sell my brass
Sell all my failures
Can't fall off-dance myself

Will you come with me?
Put your loneliness inside
Where else you can go though?
Take me to higher heights

Higher and Higher and Higher
And Higher and Higher and Higher
Those weren't over

Higher and Higher and Higher
And Higher and Higher and Higher
Hope we never calm down

Just give me your care now
Don't leave me to saving grace
She comes out at midnight
To take all my cares away

Higher and Higher and Higher
And Higher and Higher and Higher
Those weren't over

Higher and Higher and Higher
And Higher and Higher and Higher
Hope we never calm down

Higher and Higher and Higher
And Higher and Higher and Higher
Those weren't over

Higher and Higher and Higher
And Higher and Higher and Higher
Hope we never calm down
