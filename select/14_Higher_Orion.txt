There is never a reason why
In the end I don't seem to fly
All alone all I do is try to rise
There is never a place to hide
All the things that you keep inside
Maybe now I need you to fly
Higher higher
We'll go higher higher
Floating on the clouds of cream
& Sleeping on the dreams
Of you & I
& Whenever a cold blue day
Makes me feel all alone & grey
In the end I just close my eyes & lie
& Forevеr with you I'll be
'Cause therе's no much time left to see
If the magic can help us to be free
Higher higher
We'll go higher higher
Floating on the clouds of cream
& Sleeping on the dreams
Of you & I
